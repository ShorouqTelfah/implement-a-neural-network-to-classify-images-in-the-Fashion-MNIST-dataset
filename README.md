 Fashion MNIST Image Classification with Neural Networks
the aim of this repository to Implement a neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, starting with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), sigmoid activation, and cross-entropy error function. Later, we will explore alternative methods and compare the results.

Training Setup:

Set the number of epochs to 10.
Use a batch size of 1000.
Record train loss, train accuracy, test loss, and test accuracy for performance evaluation.
